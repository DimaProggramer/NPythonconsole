# NPythonconsole
This is a console created by me on Python
<br>it works on system commands(os.system, os.mkdir ...)
<br>There is also configuration(configforn.py)
<br>if you are on a PC you should replace the paths with C:\conpyt in allowed_dir, def console():, create_directories
<br>Why am I doing this? Who am I doing this to? no one looks at my repositories...
